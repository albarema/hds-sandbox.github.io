The full team of Sandbox data scientists hosted a 4 hour workshop at the Danish Bioinformatics conference where they gave a taster session of each of our 3 omics apps. We learned that multi-omics analysis were a substantial draw for the crowd at the DBC and are making plans to address this interest in future events.
