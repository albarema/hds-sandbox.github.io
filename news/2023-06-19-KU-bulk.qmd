Our teaching team (from the Sandbox, the HeaDS DataLab, and reNEW's genomics platform) hosted another 3 day workshop on bulk RNA-seq. The 34 participants used the updated version of the UCloud Transcriptomics App which provided the smoothest experience yet for both trainers and trainees. A new goal for the next course run is to add a student project to support independent implementation and exploration of the course content.
