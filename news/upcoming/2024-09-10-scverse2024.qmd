We will run a workshop on dimensionality reduction on single cell data (transcriptomics and spatial) with a focus on 
- state of the art techniques, 
- graph optimization VS laplacian operators
- how to create interactive webpage plots to document your work in a FAIR and open access manner

The workshop will be running first [at the conference](https://scverse.org/conference2024) and afterwards be available at [the dedicated webpage](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/scverse-2024-workshop) for everyone to use. The link to the workshop will work correctly after 10th september 2024.
