<h1 align="center">Welcome to the Health Data Science Sandbox User Guide</h1>

**Purpose:** We support health data science training and research in Denmark (and beyond)

**Methods:**  We link GDPR-safe, non-person-sensitive health datasets, teaching materials and tutorials, analysis tools, and compute power from Danish supercomputers  in a training/prototyping-ready environment which we call the Sandbox

**Features:** We package topical datasets and tutorials/teaching material as modules hosted on Github (see left menu for specific descriptions). Analysis demos are provided as R Markdowns and Python Jupyter notebooks wherever possible. See our Github org at [hds-sandbox](https://github.com/hds-sandbox) for access. These resources and required computational tools are installed and managed in Sandbox environments provided by Computerome (DTU) and UCloud (SDU) where compute resources can also be requested. 

**Usage:** We are currently supporting courses in health data science, where students are granted access to the Sandbox on request by collaborating professors. We plan to open Sandbox access to a broader user base starting with university students and researchers once more modules are developed. See our contact page if you have questions.

**Support:** We are currently providing support through a Sandbox slack channel. See our contact page for more information.

**Contribute:** The Sandbox welcomes proposals for new courses, modules, and prototyping projects from researchers. We'd like to partner with lecturers engaged with us in developing needed materials collaboratively - we would love to have input from subject experts or help promote exciting new tools and analysis methods via modules! Please contact us with your ideas at nhds_sandbox@sund.ku.dk.
