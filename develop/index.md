**Purpose:** We support and advance health data science training and research in Denmark (and beyond).

**Methods:**  We link GDPR-safe, non-person-sensitive health datasets, teaching materials and tutorials, analysis tools, and compute power from Danish supercomputers  in a training/prototyping-ready environment which we call the Sandbox.

**Features:** We package topical datasets and tutorials/teaching material as [training modules](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/modules) that cover clinical, biological, and practical computing subjects that are relevant to analyzing large biomedical datasets. Analysis demos are provided as R Markdowns and Python Jupyter notebooks wherever possible. Materials are open-source and publicly available via our Github org at [hds-sandbox](https://github.com/hds-sandbox). These resources are paired with HPC power and required computational tools at Computerome (DTU) and UCloud (SDU). 

**Usage:** We support and run [courses](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/news) in health data science on Computerome and UCloud, where students are granted access to the Sandbox via course leaders. We are also actively deploying training modules as apps on UCloud which trainees can access independently for self-guided tutorials. Independent access to Sandbox materials on Computerome is also under development.  See our [Access](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/access) page for updates and our [Contact](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/contact) page if you have questions.

**Support:** We are currently providing active support for courses through a Sandbox slack workspace. See our [Contact](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/contact) page for more information.

**Contribute:** The Sandbox welcomes proposals for new courses, modules, and prototyping projects from researchers and educators. We'd like to partner with lecturers engaged with us in developing needed materials collaboratively - we would love to have input from subject experts or help promote exciting new tools and analysis methods via modules!
