# Modules
</center>

One of the main roles of the Sandbox is to develop tutorials and courses for those that want to 
develop their skills in bioinformatics-related disciplines. We regularly host 
physical courses and workshops to researchers and students, but below you can find 
training modules where the material has been adapted to accommodate a **self-guided approach**. 
Please choose your topic of interest and you will find available materials and a 
guide for their intended use. Feel free to adapt the materials for your own purposes 
(with credit to the National Health Data Science Sandbox project). 
 

## Genomics

![genomics](../assets/images/genomics.png){ align=right width="200" }

Genomics is the study of genomes, the complete set of an organism's DNA. Genomics research now encompasses functional and structural studies, epigenomics, and metagenomics, 
and genomic medicine is under active implementation and extension in the health sector.

## Transcriptomics

Transcriptomics is the study of transcriptomes, which investigates RNA transcripts within a cell or tissue 
to determine what genes are being expressed and in what proportion. These RNA transcripts include 
mRNAs, tRNA, rRNA and other non-coding RNA presents in a cell.

#### [:material-abugida-devanagari: Single-Cell RNAseq](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/scRNASeq_course/) (self-tutorial version of workshop with date TBA) 


![proteomics](../assets/images/proteomics.png){ align=right width="200" }


## Proteomics

Proteomics is the study of proteins that are produced by an organism. Proteomics allows us to 
analyse protein compositon and structure, which have great importance in determining 
their function.

Below is a link to documentation for the Proteomics Sandbox, a virtual environment available on UCloud that contains pre-installed tools such as Fragpipe and MaxQuant that enable running a complete proteomics analysis. 

#### [Proteomics Sandbox](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/proteomics-sandbox/index.html) (documentation version from May 2023)

Training modules linked to the Proteomics Sandbox are currently under development and will be listed below as they're completed.

We also offer a tutorial on the independent UCloud app for using ColabFold, a tool that allows predictions with AlphaFold2 or RoseTTAFold.

#### [ColabFold Intro](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/proteomics-sandbox/colabfold.html) (instructions for using workshop material from October 2022) 
 

 ![EHRs](../assets/images/EHRs.png){ align=right width="200" }


## Electronic Health Records

Electronic health records (EHRs) are digital records kept in the public health sector that record the medical histories of individuals, and access is normally highly restricted to preserve patient privacy. 
This data is sometimes also shared (partly or in full) in secondary patient registries that support research of a specific disease or condition (such as cystic fibrosis). 
These datasets are extraordinarily valuable in the development of predictive models used in precision medicine.

Modules linked to EHR analysis are currently under development. An initial synthetic dataset was deployed for a course in the [MSc in Personal Medicine](https://personligmedicin.ku.dk/) program.


#### ![HPC-Lab](../assets/images/HPC.png){ align=right width="200" } 

 
## HPC Lab

Advanced computing skills are a foundational skill for use of the above training modules. We aim to provide tutorials that allow the use of standard programming languages for health data science (R and Python) but additional skills in Linux/bash will likely be necessary in any health data scientist's career. Additional knowledge such as the use of version control (git and GitHub) and how to efficiently leverage high performance computing (HPC) resources provided by a local cluster, an academic supercomputer such as Computerome or UCloud, and commercial cloud computing is also of value.

#### [HeaDS DataLab workshop materials](https://center-for-health-data-science.github.io/index.html) (workshops for programming and good practices developed by the Center for Health Data Science at University of Copenhagen, which are sometimes co-taught by Sandbox staff!)
