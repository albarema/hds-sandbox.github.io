# Access to the Sandbox Environment

Versions of the Sandbox environment are under development at Computerome and UCloud, the two major Danish supercomputers located at DTU and SDU, respectively. Please [contact](mailto:nhds_sandbox@sund.ku.dk) us with any access queries, and see the below guides for how to access the environment on your platform of choice once you are an approved user.

Sandbox module material is also open access via our [GitHub organization page](https://github.com/hds-sandbox), and you are welcome to implement modules on your own machine or platform.
