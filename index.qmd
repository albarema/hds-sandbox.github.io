The Health Data Science Sandbox is a national project coordinated by the [Center for Health Data Science](https://heads.ku.dk/) at the University of Copenhagen. We're working with a network of health data science experts to build training resources on academic supercomputers for students and researchers in Denmark. Our Sandbox contains [training modules](https://hds-sandbox.github.com/modules/index.html) that pair topical datasets with recommended analysis tools, pipelines, and learning materials/tutorials in a portable, containerized format.

<h2 align="center" style="margin:0px">To get involved as a trainee, researcher, or educator in Denmark:</h2>
<center>
TRAINEES: [join](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/news/news.html) our next scheduled workshop or a supported university course                                    

TRAINEES/RESEARCHERS: explore [training modules](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/modules/index.html) independently on UCloud

RESEARCHERS: adapt [training modules](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/modules/index.html) or [code repositories](https://github.com/hds-sandbox) to your research

EDUCATORS: [host](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/access/) a training event or course in the Sandbox with our support

<center> **A note on Sandbox data policy** </center>

The Sandbox aims to be a resource for learning new analysis approaches and tools for health data science on useful, interesting, and safe-to-share datasets. All person-specific datasets in the Sandbox are non-sensitive and GDPR-safe because they are 1) sourced from public databases, 2) fully anonymous/non-sensitive from a GDPR perspective, and/or 3) synthetic. To learn more, check out [Datasets](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/datasets/datapolicy.html) where we explain our data policy in detail and our approach to synthetic data generation.
